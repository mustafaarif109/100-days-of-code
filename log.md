# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learn some basics for design patterns in JAVA, their normal use cases, importance and the logic to implement them. Implemented factory design method from scratch.

**Thoughts:** Design Patterns are something that I have listened people talk about a lot and I have used multiple of them but still want to get some basics right for them and so I have started to learn it from scratch again and It was a good experience.

### Day 1: March 6th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learn some basics for builder design pattern. Implemented builder design pattern in JAVA.

**Thoughts:** Builder design pattern was a little tricky to implement but I can think of a lot of use cases for it. I believe this design pattern could be very useful specially in cases where there are a lot of parameters in a constructor

### Day 2: March 7th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learn some basics for adapter design pattern. Implemented adapter design pattern in JAVA. Also Learned about the differences between Git, Github and Gitlab

**Thoughts:** Adapter design pattern was simple to implement and understand. The design pattern could be helpful in various cases when there is legacy code in a project as we can't change our already present implementations. Learning about git, github and gitlab differences was also very refreshing for my git knowledge and I don't have much knowledge regarding its difference though I have used all of them consisitently so to be able to grasp the differences now is also a plus. Fun day of coding overall
