**Today's Progress**: Learn some basics for design patterns in JAVA, their normal use cases, importance and the logic to implement them. Implemented factory design method from scratch.

**Thoughts:** Design Patterns are something that I have listened people talk about a lot and I have used multiple of them but still want to get some basics right for them and so I have started to learn it from scratch again and It was a good experience.

### Day 1: March 6th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learn some basics for builder design pattern. Implemented builder design pattern in JAVA.

**Thoughts:** Builder design pattern was a little tricky to implement but I can think of a lot of use cases for it. I believe this design pattern could be very useful specially in cases where there are a lot of parameters in a constructor
