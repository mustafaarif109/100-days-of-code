**Today's Progress**: Learn some basics for design patterns in JAVA, their normal use cases, importance and the logic to implement them. Implemented factory design method from scratch.

**Thoughts:** Design Patterns are something that I have listened people talk about a lot and I have used multiple of them but still want to get some basics right for them and so I have started to learn it from scratch again and It was a good experience.
